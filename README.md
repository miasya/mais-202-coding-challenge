# MAIS 202 - Application Coding Challenge

## Storytime
So coming from C++, I didn't know like ANY Python libraries, so I went through many iterations in this challenge. The first file demonstrates my initial brute force solution with no external libraries and limited familiarity with Python data structures. Within, I parse the data using csv.DictReader() and manipulate tuples to produce my desired output. The next file uses the same idea for data processing, but includes a visualization of the output using a bar chart implemented with Matplotlib. Now satisfied with my output, my next step was to improve the design of the internal processes of the program. More specifically, I searched for array manipulation libraries and came across NumPy and Pandas, which both appeared to be widely used and supported. My final decision was to use Pandas (which is actually based on NumPy) because the dataframes offered more functionality and because I really like the animal Pandas.

I MEAN LOOK AT HOW CUTE THEY ARE!

Yes I know Pandas isn't named after the animal but still :D

# Tl;dr "I just want the instructions"
## How to Run
Run file: "CSV_reader_with_pandas_and_matplotlib.py"

Make sure you have Pandas and Matplotlib installed & make sure that "data.csv" is in the same folder as the .py file.

Note that a screenshot of the output has been included for your convenience :)
